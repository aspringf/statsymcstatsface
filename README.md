# Statsy McStatsface
A stats blog for the masses.

## What is this?

This is a blog on which I intend to discuss statistics,
in a way that is accessible for the casual reader.
The idea is to explain in plain language statistical
concepts from the big wide world.
I might pick up on news or current events, for example.
